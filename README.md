Brian is creating a simple digital clock application using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

The application is displaying the clock but the time isn't changing like it's supposed to. Brian decides to reach out to you and asks you:

I have come to a sticking pont with my clock app. For the life of me I cannot get the clock to "tick" when the page loads. I have been setting timeouts, setting intervals, and I even found requestAnimationFrame() in the Mozilla docs. Any tips would be greatly appreciated. Here's a link to my codepen: [https://github.com/andysterks/supportc-coach-clock-bug](https://github.com/andysterks/supportc-coach-clock-bug)

Pull down Brian's project onto your computer and see if you can give him an idea of how to proceed.

Make sure to explain why things aren't working properly and suggest how to get the clock to "tick".
